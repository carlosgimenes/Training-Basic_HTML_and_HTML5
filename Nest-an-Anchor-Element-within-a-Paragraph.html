    Sobre a aula Nest an Anchor Element within a Paragraph
        You can nest links within other text elements.

            <p>
            Here's a <a target="_blank" href="http://freecodecamp.org"> link to freecodecamp.org</a> for you to follow.
            </p>
        
        Let's break down the example: Normal text is wrapped in the p element:
        <p> Here's a ... for you to follow. </p> Next is the anchor element <a> (which requires a closing tag </a>):
        <a> ... </a> target is an anchor tag attribute that specifies where to open the link and the value "_blank" specifies to open the link in a new tab href is an anchor tag attribute that contains the URL address of the link:
        <a href="http://freecodecamp.org"> ... </a> The text, "link to freecodecamp.org", within the a element called anchor text, will display a link to click:
        <a href=" ... ">link to freecodecamp.org</a> The final output of the example will look like this:

        Here's a link to freecodecamp.org for you to follow
